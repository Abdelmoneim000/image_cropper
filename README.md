## Docker Environment Setup

The project uses Docker to create a consistent and isolated environment. The Docker setup is defined in the [Dockerfile](#file:Dockerfile-context). This file specifies the use of Python 3.8-slim as the base image, sets the working directory, copies the current directory contents into the container, installs the necessary packages from `requirements.txt`, exposes port 5000, sets the `FLASK_APP` environment variable to `app.py`, and specifies the command to run the Flask application.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure Docker is properly configured and running on your system before proceeding with the installation. The Dockerfile assumes a stable internet connection for package installation from `requirements.txt`.

> [!WARNING]
> Modifications to the Dockerfile should be made with caution to avoid breaking dependencies or compromising the environment's integrity.

## Python Scripts

### list.py

The [`list.py`](#file:list.py-context) script is designed to list and remove all Python packages, excluding some common standard libraries such as `pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel`. This script is useful for cleaning up the environment or ensuring a minimal set of packages are installed.

### pp.py

The [`pp.py`](#file:pp.py-context) script is used to send a request to a server for testing purposes. It defines a URL and JSON payload, sends a POST request to the specified URL, and saves the received image to `cropped_image.jpg`. This script demonstrates how to interact with web services and handle file outputs in Python.

### Crop_CLIP.ipynb

The `Crop_CLIP.ipynb` script is an adaptation from a Colab notebook designed for image processing and similarity search using CLIP and YOLOv5 models within a Flask web application.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure proper setup of CLIP and YOLOv5 models as specified in the notebook for accurate image processing. Flask web application environment must support Python libraries `flask` and `flask_cors` for endpoint functionality.

> [!WARNING]
> Use caution when modifying the script to avoid unintended changes to image processing or model interactions. Verify URL inputs to `/crop` endpoint to prevent potential security risks or malicious attacks.

#### Overview

This script integrates CLIP and YOLOv5 models to perform the following tasks:

- **Process Image Files**: Fetch and preprocess images using requests and PIL libraries.
- **Crop Image**: Utilize YOLOv5 for object detection and cropping of images, saving the results locally.
- **Get Similar Image**: Use CLIP model to find the most visually similar image to a specified query.

#### Usage

The script exposes a Flask endpoint `/crop` to handle POST requests with JSON data containing a URL and optional search query. It processes the image from the provided URL, crops it using YOLOv5, identifies the most similar image using CLIP, and returns the result as a JPEG image.

## Dependencies

The project's dependencies are listed in the [`requirements.txt`](#file:requirements.txt-context) file. These include libraries necessary for YOLOv5, image processing, data manipulation, and web service interaction, such as `numpy`, `torch`, `Pillow`, `opencv-python`, and `requests`, among others.


> [!NOTE]
> Review and update `requirements.txt` regularly to maintain compatibility with latest library versions and security patches.


> [!WARNING]
> Install dependencies in a controlled environment to prevent conflicts with existing Python installations or libraries. Verify compatibility of new library versions with existing codebase before updating dependencies.
